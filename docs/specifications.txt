-- TITLE --
GOALTRACKER

-- PURPOSE --
The following file simulates my ideal functionality for the project.

Ideally the application will have an account feature as well as
a daily tracker for the progress of the user's goals. The progress
will correspond to the user's input as to how much they have 
accomplished over a given time period. 

-- REQUIREMENTS --

1. Google Account Integration
2. Different time constraints for goals
3. Different entry types for goal accomplishment
4. Multiple goals
5. Display graphs of progress

-- ENVIRONMENT --

1. People don't want to spend a long time entering data
2. Some people might want to share their progress, some may not
3. Goals are met after a certain threshold of progress is made
4. Goals are unique to a specific user, not shared
